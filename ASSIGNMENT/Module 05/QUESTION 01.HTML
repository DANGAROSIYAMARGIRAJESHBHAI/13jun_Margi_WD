        <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
        <p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
        <p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
        <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
        <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:

            HTML/DOM manipulation<br>
            CSS manipulation<br>
            HTML event methods<br>
            Effects and animations<br>
            AJAX<br>
            Utilities</p>
